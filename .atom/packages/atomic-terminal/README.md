## Active Terminal

The active terminal is the terminal that will be used when sending commands to
the terminal.

The active terminal will always have an astrix (`*`) in front of the title.
By default when a terminal is hidden it becomes inactive and the last used
visible terminal will become active. If there are no visible terminals none are
active.

The `Allow Hidden Terminal To Stay Active` setting will change the
default behavior and keep a terminal that is hidden active until another
terminal is focused.

## Services

For plugin writers, the `terminal` package supports two services, `terminal` and `platformioIDETerminal`, which
can be used to easily open terminals. These methods are provided using Atom's [services](http://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/interacting-with-other-packages-via-services/)
API.

To use a service, add a consumer method to consume the service, or
rather a JavaScript object that provides methods to open terminals and run commands.

### 'terminal' service v1.0.0

The `terminal` service provides an [object](https://github.com/atom-community/terminal/blob/29b0751250cb9262fb609db8cae87d87fb383c64/src/terminal.js#L291) with `updateProcessEnv`, `run`, `getTerminalViews`, and `open` methods.

As an example on how to use the provided `run()` method, your
`package.json` should have the following.

```json
{
  "consumedServices": {
    "terminal": {
      "versions": {
        "^1.1.0": "consumePlatformioIDETerminalService"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Your package's main module should then define a `consumePlatformioIDETerminalService`
method, for example.

```js
import { Disposable } from "atom"

export default {
  terminalService: null,

  consumePlatformioIDETerminalService(terminalService) {
    this.terminalService = terminalService
    return new Disposable(() => {
      this.terminalService = null
    })
  },

  // . . .
}
```

Once the service is consumed, use the `run()` method that is provided
by the service, for example.

```js
// Launch `somecommand --foo --bar --baz` in a terminal.
this.terminalService.run(["somecommand --foo --bar --baz"])
```

# Development

Want to help develop terminal? Here's how to quickly get setup.

First use the [apm](https://github.com/atom/apm) command to clone the
[terminal repo](https://github.com/atom-community/terminal).

```sh
apm develop terminal
```

This should clone the terminal package into the `$HOME/github/terminal`
directory. Go into this directory and install its dependencies.

```sh
cd $HOME/github/terminal
npm install
```

You shouldn't need to rebuild any [node-pty](https://github.com/Tyriar/node-pty)
since they are pre-compiled, however in the event they aren't available,
you can rebuild them with:

```sh
apm rebuild
```

Finally, open this directory in Atom's dev mode and hack away.

```sh
atom --dev
```

There's a test suite available for automated testing of the terminal package.
Simply go to `View > Developer > Run Package Specs` in Atom's main menu or
use the hotkey. You can run the full test suite (which includes running lint
tools) via command-line by running `npm run test` inside the terminal
directory.

Various lint tools are being used to keep the code "beautified". To run only
the lint tools, simply run `npm run lint`.

## Pull Requests

Whenever you're ready to submit a pull request, be sure to submit it
against a fork of the main [terminal repo](https://github.com/atom-community/terminal)
master branch that you'll own. Fork the repo using Github and make note of the
new `git` URL. Set this new git URL as the URL for the `origin` remote in your
already cloned git repo is follows.

```sh
git remote set-url origin ${NEW_GIT_URL}
```

Ensure your new changes passes the test suite by running `npm run test`.
Afterwards, push your changes to your repo and then use Github to submit a new
pull request.

## [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js)

The terminals that users interact with in this package is made possible with
major help from the [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) library. As
such, often times it's necessary to make changes to xterm.js in order to fix
some bug or implement new features.

If you want to work on xterm.js for the benefit of a bug fix or feature to be
supported in terminal, here's how you can quickly get setup.

First make a fork of [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js). Next,
clone your newly created fork as follows.

```sh
git clone ${YOUR_XTERMJS_FORK} ${HOME}/github/xterm.js
```

Go into your newly cloned repo for xterm.js.

```sh
cd ${HOME}/github/xterm.js
```

Install all needed dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

Build xterm.js.

```sh
npm run build
```

Ensure the test suite passes.

```sh
npm run test
npm run lint
```

Add a global link for xterm.js to your system.

```sh
npm link
```

Inside your terminal directory, link against the global `xterm` link.

```sh
cd ${HOME}/github/terminal
npm link xterm
```

Finally, perform a rebuild with the [apm](https://github.com/atom/apm) program
inside the terminal directory.

```sh
apm rebuild
```

You're all set for developing xterm.js. Hack away in your xterm.js directory,
run `npm run build`, then reload your Atom window to see the changes to your
terminals.
